== bugs ==

  * double ctl + C needed to terminate


== launcher actions ==

  * make sure the processname uses the symlink name, may require using os.exec for this


== code coolness ==

  * switch to using Input and Output for the file streaming parts
  * assertion macros
  * parm logging macros
  * logging macros that auto wrap in an if


== features ==

    * early log file setup
    * properly set tmp folder
    * auto restart w/backoff

    * cull logs by
        * size threshold
        * age threshold
    * warning/notification system


== possibly someday ==

    * external trigger to roll log files
    * semaphore to run a single instance
    * push log IO to hermes
    * when rolling a log file into archives if the archive file already exists use a different name (don't delete it)
    * roll triggers
        * time e.g. midnight
        * size of file
        * size of both files
        * size of log folder
        * size of archives folder
        * size of this instances log files


== DONE ==

    * put header in log file on first IO with timestamp of first IO
    * timestamped log files (DONE)
    * entry date and time as the header for every log file
        * stderr log is empty and on first bytes gets this header
    * gzip and archive log files
    * where to put logs directory
    * handling of java symlink
    * auto set appname
