== bugs ==

  * double ctl + C needed to terminate


== launcher actions ==

  * do we integrate with the installer ?
    * (install | upgrade) to a (version | latest)
      * make sure we have the artifacts locally 
        * use a8 repo
    * unpackge the app
  * properly get symlink as the process name


== code coolness ==
  * StreamOps and PathOps working from macros (so can be put in import.hx)

== features ==

    * early log file setup
    * auto restart config setting
    * properly set tmp folder
    * auto restart w/backoff

    * cull logs by
        * size threshold
        * age threshold
    * warning/notification system


== possibly someday ==

    * external trigger to roll log files
    * semaphore to run a single instance
    * push log IO to hermes
    * when rolling a log file into archives if the archive file already exists use a different name (don't delete it)
    * roll triggers
        * time e.g. midnight
        * size of file
        * size of both files
        * size of log folder
        * size of archives folder
        * size of this instances log files


== DONE ==

    * put header in log file on first IO with timestamp of first IO
    * timestamped log files (DONE)
    * entry date and time as the header for every log file
        * stderr log is empty and on first bytes gets this header
    * gzip and archive log files
    * where to put logs directory
    * handling of java symlink
    * auto set appname
